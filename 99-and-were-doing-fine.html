                <p>It took a little while for us to read between the lines and determine our constraints for this project, but once we found them, I believe it helped us all. We decided to meet the night before our project was due to start defining the scope of our ideas. We had two initial constraints.</p>

                <p>Time and our collective domain knowledge, which was surprisingly vast.</p>

                <p>We did some brain writing of ideas and came back an hour later to review. Coming up with initial ideas is hard for me, but once there’s an idea, it’s easier for me to build upon it and flesh that idea out. We parted for the evening with the goal of working on our micro business plans for the ideas we generated that fit into our areas of domain knowledge.</p>

                <p>With 6 hours before our deadline, we met again tonight to catch up and determine if we were on track. Through re-reading of the post several more times and touching base with our coach, we added two more constraints.</p>

                <p>A VC funded company and storytelling (from Business Model Generation).</p>

                <p>With our constraints defined, we broke again to outline more of our business plans for the ideas we had generated.</p>

                <p>By 9pm it was time for an all-out sprint and thankfully Karma Neff, Karen Welle and I are getting this in just in time.</p>
