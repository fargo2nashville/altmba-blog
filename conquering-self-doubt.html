                <p>Why is it that in this stage of my life I find the hardest part of goal setting is deciding on a goal? Setting a goal is how I ended up in Nashville. When did I stop dreaming and setting goals to achieve those dreams? I’ve been in Nashville for nine years and I struggle with what I want next. Deep inside I believe that struggle is tied to my self-doubt. That’s one of the main reasons I am here. To remind myself that I am capable of more!</p>

                <p>As I read Zig Ziglar’s writings on setting goals, two things he said smacked me in the face. “Goals give you the ability to do something today to create the future you want.” and “It is better to set goals and have direction than to not have goals and wander around in confusion.” – Zig Ziglar</p>

                <p>Worse than wandering around in confusion, I’ve been standing still…afraid to chart a new path…waiting for things to happen. It’s time to stop standing around and set a direction.</p>

                <p>I have chosen to focus this assignment on pursuing freelance work for extra income. This idea has been in the back of my mind for some time, and yet I have not taken any action. Sounds like a good reason to give it a goal!</p>

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Earn $300 in extra monthly income by freelancing on the side. My focus will be on photo retouching and creating photo books.</p>

                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A little extra income would help fund my love of travel and photographing my experiences. Both of these hobbies can be expensive. Freelancing, as opposed to finding a part-time job, would allow me to set my own hours and chose the projects I work on. The earning potential and time commitment is in my hands.</p>

                <p><strong>Obstacles:</strong> The biggest obstacle is myself! Even though I am far more “left-brain” than “right brain,” I enjoy being creative. However, the constant thought that runs through my head when thinking about creating something for others is “what if they don’t like it?” As I gain more experience in the in the creative field and put myself out there, I think this will be less of an obstacle for me.</p>

                <p>Another obstacle will be the initial promotion and finding the first clients.</p>

                <p><strong>Skills And Knowledge:</strong> I am versed in Photoshop, Lightroom, and several photo book applications. I have an eye for page layouts, spacing, and imaging. I have some web experience, but if I am going to launch my own website to promote my services, I will need to learn more. I can easily do this through online forums and tutorials.</p>

                <p><strong>People And Groups:</strong> My personal connections will be important to get this off the ground. Not only to provide encouragement but also to connect me with potential clients.</p>

                <p><strong>Plan Of Action:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine specifics of what I am able to offer clients and pricing.</li>
                    <li>Research what others charge for similar services.</li>
                    <li>Create an online portfolio of my work.</li>
                    <li>Start sharing my work with friends who may have connections with those that need my services.</li>
                    <li>Start creating for clients.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Deadline: December 2015</strong></p>
